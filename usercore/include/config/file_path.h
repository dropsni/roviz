 * @brief Class used as a tag for file paths
 *
 * A string and a file path are basically the same thing, but they have
 * different meanings and widgets for a config. You can use this as the type
 * for a config and you'll get a nice file-selector widget. The value of the
 * config will be a string list (because you can select multiple file).
