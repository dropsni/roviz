 * thread and can process the image data.
 *
 * The templated functions need to know on what kind of stream they operate.
 * Examples might be Image or Message. You can also implement your own
 * stream-type. Look at Stream<T> for more information. Trying to call e.g.
 * next() with the wrong stream type for the given input will result in
 * undefined behavior!
